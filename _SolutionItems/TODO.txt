CURRENT NOTES
============================================================================================
PAGES:
- put history on same page
- make blank section look nicer
- show icons on tree (inc. for enabled/disabled)
- remove "Create Sub Page" button after 3 levels
- move Page Types to separate page? Alternatively, make it more intuitive..
- make custom tinymce config (cant have widget zones in other editors- its for pages only)
- Delete sub pages when delete page (or move those subpages up 1 level)?
- Page Types: should editortemplatepath be overridable? maybe only display template?
TODO: change from page history to page versioning instead (keep all pages in page version table - including current..)
-    then: we can make page preview work with unsaved versions of pages
- allow deleting of translated pages (the prob we should also see history for it, etc..)

- context menu for media is far down below

- cleanup View360 editor template (use tabs or accordion)

- page preview in history still has some issues (not showing correct css in soem cases, like missing breadcrumbs or hidden text under navbar)
	- AND worse: it seems to mess with the admin navbar - better to show preview in modal or OTHER tab (have a button)

- plugin idea: live chat
- dont load entityType configurations if plugin not loaded..

- do validation for settings

- do we need a different default frontend layout path for mobile theme? probably...

- read through security guidlines as requested by Ran
- page types: have a "List" template? To show all records (for that type) in a grid, for example?

CONTENT BLOCK ERROR: TinyMCE should not be included by default and should be loaded from specific blocks that need it..
	this will also affect other libs..!

LOCALIZATION:
- Allow editing of invariant culture strings
- how to localize strings in StringLengthAttribute, etc?
- localize content blocks
- localize blog entries
- localize message templates
- localizable routes... then can have localized sitemap (see: https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/2620865?hl=en)
- localizable enums?
- localize accoutn views
- localize error pages (404, etc)
- import/export language packs (from localized strings table)
- use {0:G} date format in all kendo grids?

FORM BUILDER:
- At least use markitup or something instead of wysiwyg.

CACHE
- Improve caching:
	- Trigger clearing of cache results when appropriate
	- Allow for Redis or other provider via interface
- Store Cache Keys as contants

OTHER
- Provide overloads for AutoMenu(), AutoSubmenu() and AutoBreadcrumbs() that don't require any template (just generate it for Bootstrap by default)
- admin theme settings (left or top menu, which SmartAdmin colors etc)
- need some way to provide descriptions/tooltips using an [Attribute] of some kind for widget properties (and page type properties too)..
- LOG FILE SETTINGS?
- new sitemap html page (see nop for example)
- Video Content Block
- Make moment.js part of Kore? Can have ISettings for it.. etc. Same for TinyMCE and more.
- allowing email as username is a problem in cases like Blog!
- slugify automaticlly
- reusable image picker (Html Helper?)

- minify HTML

- scheduled task to auto shrink log file?

- review all TODO notes

-remove media entities?
- KoreUI: Icons
- Content Blocks: Localization
- Content Blocks: override template path (for display only)
- dashboard widgets
- blog, store, etc for google sitemap (some kind of IPageProvider that can be used commongly for sitemap and also auto menus?)
- uninstall plugin should remove permissions

- implement this: http://plugins.krajee.com/file-input/demo#advanced-usage
	- for product images, import lang pack, etc..
  
- SIMPLE ECOMMERCE
  - comments/reviews
  - star ratings?
  - product images
  - product attributes (filter widget based on this + generic fields like price, etc)
 - make it more secure (PayPal) by removing BuyNow.cshtml and replacing it with c# code only (use HttpClient)

  - regions: add some button for importing common public data files (liek MaxMind)
  
   - admin page for blocking some IPs (inc. import IP block list files)
  
  - use ajax pages for logged in users! gr8 idea!!! that way, keep good SEO and then have incentive for users to sign up as well
  
 -- NEED LOAD TESTING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
  
  - TO CHECK: if multiple libs ref 1 shared lib, does that shared lib's dependencies get loaded multiple times? If yes, set a static variable to check whether its already loaded
  
  - REVISE AUTO CACHE KEYS IN Generic Service!! Because they might conflict (not unique) if have 2 entities with same name in diff library
  
- thin arrow for treeview sub items?

- consider making all odata actions return IHttpActionResult

- HTML Helpers for generic ui layout (can have bootstrap provider, kendo provider, foundation provider, etc)...

- use output caching more
- plugins should be published along with site

- Use HTML5 semantic tags properly everywhere

TO TEST:
LocationFormatProvider can probably be used to make View() work without providing embedded view name. example:

return new[]
{
	"~/Themes/{3}/Kore.Web.ContentManagement/Areas/{2}/Views/{1}/{0}.cshtml",
	"~/Themes/{3}/Kore.Web.ContentManagement/Areas/{2}/Views/Shared/{0}.cshtml",
	"~/Areas/{2}/Views/Kore.Web.ContentManagement/{1}/{0}.cshtml",
	"~/Areas/{2}/Views/Kore.Web.ContentManagement/Shared/{0}.cshtml",
	"Kore.Web.ContentManagement.Areas.{2}.Views.{1}.{0}",
	"Kore.Web.ContentManagement.Areas.{2}.Views.Shared.{0}",
};

// probelm with this is area names have a slash.. example:  Admin/Pages (how to translate to Admin.Pages ?)

GOOGLE:
- add translate widget?

OLDER NOTES
============================================================================================
TODO:
- CMS
	- Lists
	- SEO (Later)
	- Backups (Later)
	- Aliases (Later)
- Razor intellisense not working for class libraries


Learn more about "contenteditable" attribute:
http://html5doctor.com/the-contenteditable-attribute/

- investigate RequireJS ( see Durandal)

BUGS:
- captcha settings

if normal view, use breadcrumbs.. not needed if only partial view

- don't load dependencies from web dll.. instead, provide a static class which can do that (call it from main app) if the dev wants (default) or else they can override the registrations with their own in the main app
- minification & bundling for script and style registers (do we even need these registers?)

- HTML/CSS framework builder: interface, so can use bootstrap, foundation, etc (HTML Helpers)

	- (DONE) Media
	- (DONE) Menus
	- (DONE) Messaging (Message Templates)
	- (DONE) Widgets (In progress)

- (DONE) Localization: Use some kind of interface so that any storage medium can be used (DB, XML, even RESX, etc)
		NOTE: Might convert to NOP Localization or merge some of their ideas (like Localized Routes)
- (DONE) Logging  (Needs TESTING)
- (DONE) Caching  (Needs TESTING - especially in WinForms)- UPDATE 2014.09.11: Check if it supports distributed caching
- (DONE) Events  (Needs TESTING)
- Customizable Membership Service  (Needs TESTING)
	TODO:
	- Implement JQColumnAttribute class for models.. then user just needs to do: .AddColumnFor(m=> m.ColumnName)
- web api security (its protected so only logged on users can use it, but we may need to make changes to have it open for mobile, etc.. later)
	

FUTURE:
- Tenants (FUTURE VERSION - NOT INITIAL RELEASE)
- IOC Container (DI)... make it so can use any.. Autofac, Ninject, etc..
- Features System
- jqGrid HTML Helper: SubGrid
- Installation Page


- forums plugin,
- wiki plugin (roadkill?)
- Visitor Groups
- virtual path providers
