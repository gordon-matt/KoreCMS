            Maximizing the amount of data sent per TCP segment is good because it
            amortizes the overhead of the send. However, in some cases (most notably
            telnet or rlogin) small segments may need to be sent without delay. This
            is less efficient than sending larger amounts of data at a time, and can
            contribute to congestion on the network if overdone.

            used in their web applications. It is primarily meant as a
            support for Kerberos5 authentication but may be also used along
            with another authentication methods. For more information see IETF
            draft draft-brezak-spnego-http-04.txt.
            <note>
            You need to use a version of libcurl.NET built with a suitable
            GSS-API library for this to work. This is not currently standard.
